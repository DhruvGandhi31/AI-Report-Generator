# AI-Generated Analysis Report
## Project Overview
This project aims to generate a comprehensive analysis report on the distribution of medals across different countries using Python. The report includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, and textual summaries of the analysis, all compiled into a structured PDF document. The primary goal is to automate the creation of analytical reports using AI, focusing on sports data, particularly the distribution of medals.

## Features
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset containing medal counts for various countries.
2. Statistical Summary: Compute descriptive statistics of the medal distribution, including mean, standard deviation, and percentiles.
3. Visualizations: Generate visualizations like histograms and bar charts to explore the distribution of total medals, top performers, and comparisons between medal types.
4. AI-Generated Text Summaries: Automatically generate textual explanations of the analysis using a pre-trained language model.
5. PDF Report Generation: Compile the entire analysis into a structured PDF report with sections, tables, images, and AI-generated text.
